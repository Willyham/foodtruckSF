foodtruckSF
===========

This is a prototype for a map of all food trucks and their schedules in San Francisco. The map is based on the permit information made available via the [Data SF](http://datasf.org) website. If you haven't heard of it before then check it out - it's a bloody gold mine.
For posterity, speed, clenliness (unfortunately there is a lot of junk data in the data set) and for the sake of writing a small REST API, the data is sourced locally rather than directly using the Data SF API.
